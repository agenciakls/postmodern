        <h3>Evolution to hear and feel in your home every nuance of sound as it was conceived in the studio.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Released in the early 1980s, the CD and its 16bit/44.1kHz encoding standard were once an excellent choice for enjoying and enjoying music. Nowadays it is possible to record and distribute music with much higher bit resolution and sampling rates.</p>
        <p><strong>High-Resolution Audio</strong> (<strong>Hi-Res</strong> or simply <strong>HRA</strong>) is a format that goes beyond the 16-bit/44 standard, 1kHz from the CD. <strong>Hi-Res</strong> files typically have 24-bit resolution, allowing for a greater dynamic range than CD and sample rates up to 192kHz.</p>
        <p><strong>Hi-Res Audio</strong> files have been distributed and marketed for many years in some of their formats such as Apple\'s <strong>FLAC</strong> , <strong>ALAC</strong>, compatible with iTunes, <strong>WAV PCM</strong> and <strong>DSD</strong> via Super Audio CD (<strong>SACD</strong>) for a well-defined audience and has been gaining popularity with the evolution of markets and with easier access to a larger number of DAC converters and players capable of playing these types of files (such as <strong>Pono Player</strong> and others) and recently also via Streaming using <strong>MQA< technology /strong>. </p>


        <h5>Accuracy and detail. We take our converters, cables and interconnects very seriously.</h5>
        <p>AD and DA converters are very important pieces in the signal chain to ensure the highest resolution, purity and (health) capture and representation of sound. Each brand, each converter model has a particular design and characteristic. <strong>Post Modern Mastering</strong> has a selection of converters that enable us to capture sound with sonic transparency and remarkable detail to find more for your music.</p>

        <h5>Pacific Microsonics</h5>
        <p>Post Modern Mastering is the only Studio in Brazil to use Pacific Microsonics converters. A very rare converter and considered to be the most accurate AD/DA converter ever developed for capturing analog sound to PCM digital audio.</p>
        <p>Virtually only recordings made using Pacific Microsonics Model 1 or 2 can actually be considered <strong>True PCM HD</strong> or <strong>Real PCM</strong>. However, as Pacific Microsonics converters are so rare, few people will have actually heard of "<strong>True PCM or Real PCM</strong>" and "<strong>PCM HD</strong>".</p>

        <h5>Cables and Interconnects</h5>
        <p>Audio cables can blur or blur the sound, compromise the phase relationship, add color and characteristics.<br />Associated with AD/DA converters, our cables are extremely important elements for the pursuit of the highest level of sonic detail, nuances and atmospheric impact.</p>

        <h5>DSD Mastering and SACD Authoring</h5>
        <p>DSD or Direct Stream Digital is a format that uses a very different method of encoding: PCM format. To determine the resolution of the audio file, instead of more bit-depths, recordings made in DSD use a single bit, but have a much higher sampling frequency. Originally, the DSD64 format\'s sampling rate is 2,822MHz (64 times that of CD sampling). In recent years even higher sample rates have been developed for the DSD format, such as DSD128 and DSD265 and even DSD512).<br />DSD files are used as the basis for the Super Audio CD (SACD) format.</p>

    'page-servicos-vinyl-content' => '<h3>Search and rescue to deliver the real music enjoyment experience.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The experience of listening to a good vinyl record is unique. Many audiophiles and enthusiasts claim it\'s still the best way to hear and enjoy music. But for this experience to be truly impactful, the fidelity of the audio recorded on vinyl is extremely important. To ensure such fidelity, some aspects and elements such as engineer characteristics, noise floor, distortions, frequency response and range or dynamic range, need attention and specific adjustments in the mastering process carried out for the vinyl format that precedes the cut of the lacquers (Lacquer) and acetate.</p>

        <p>At <strong>Post Modern Mastering</strong>, we have worked extensively on the development of a vinyl-specific mastering process with the goal of drastically improving the consistency and sonic quality of the cut, contributing to the creation of vinyl records with superlative quality, magnificent and amazing sound that vinyl consumers deserve and expect to hear.</p>

        <p>Vinyl-specific mastering to generate lacquers (Lacquer) and acetates can be done in a few ways. The options we offer are:</p>
        <h4>Hi-Res Files for Vinyl</h4>
        <p>In Post Modern Mastering the entire process is carried out in High-Resolution. After mastering to vinyl, we generate <strong>Hi-Res</strong> files that will be used to cut the lacquers.</p>

        <h4>Tape Layback for Vinyl</h4>
        <p>Even if your album has been recorded and mixed in the digital environment, we do vinyl-specific mastering using our <strong>ATR 102</strong> so that the vinyl cut is made from the analog tape generated on the mastering session. Thus eliminating the need for yet another digital conversion. </p>

        <h4>Half Speed ​​Vinyl</h4>
        <p>With our unique <strong>ATR 102</strong> analog recorder we are able to generate master files at <strong>half speed</strong> for the vinyl cutting process. The <strong>half speed</strong> process generates less stress and vibration to the cutting head resulting in a vinyl with an unrivaled high frequency response, a solid and more stable stereo image, superior clarity, volume and definition.</ p>',

        <h3>Our obsession is to capture the thrill and magic of the day of recording and ensure that valuable titles and catalogs are preserved and retrieved for the future in a wide range of high-resolution formats.</h3>
        <br>
            <p>In recent years we have had the honor and immense privilege of making restorations and remasterings, from original tapes, of works of unparalleled importance to the music industry in the world. Among them, the remastering of the complete work of <strong>Djavan</strong>, the restoration and remastering of the first three albums by <strong>Joāo Gilberto</strong>, Chega de Saudade, 1959, O Amor, o Sorri e Flor, from 1960 and João Gilberto, from 1961 (these have no date set for release) and the restoration and mastering of the <strong>newly discovered and unpublished</strong> album, by <strong>Tim Maia, “Yo te Amo” </strong>, recorded in Spanish 51 years ago.</p>
            <p>In any audio remastering or restoration process, the fidelity and accuracy of the transfer from the original analog content to the digital medium is crucial. At Post Modern Mastering the restoration and remastering processes start with our exclusive <strong>Precision Tape Transfer®</strong>, a transfer method designed to capture and reproduce every detail. A powerful combination of a crystal-clear signal path designed to the highest technical standard available, our unique <strong>ATR 102</strong> analog recorder with custom electronics and reproduction heads and AD/DA converters like the <strong>Pacific Microsonics</strong>.</p>
            <p>Each project requires a unique approach that is carefully studied and defined during the process so that the sound characteristics of the original tapes are not altered, ensuring precisely the preservation of the sonic integrity, realism and emotion of the historical content. </p>
        <br>
        <h5><strong>Plangent Processes</strong><strong>®</strong></h5>
        <br>
            <p>Post Modern Mastering also offers transfers using the <strong>Plangent Processes®</strong> system in our <strong>ATR 102</strong>. A hybrid system that combines a headblock with a reproduction head, analog electronics and unique DSP system, capable of carrying out a particular process of correction of wow and flutter and imperfections generated in the mechanical process of reproduction of the analog tape, in addition to problems caused by the action of weather and poor conservation.</p>
